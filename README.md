# ProStreet Most Wanted Physics

Experiment for Need for Speed: ProStreet that converts the physics and handling model from Most Wanted and Carbon, including rechargeable NOS and the ability to use speedbreaker

Massive thanks to everyone involved with [dbalatoni13's MW reverse engineering project](https://github.com/dbalatoni13/nfsmw), this mod was heavily based off of it.

## Installation

- Make sure you have v1.1 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 3765248 or 28739656 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

## Useful info

- Fine tuning has been entirely redone, many options might change car performance in different ways than before, and the following tunings do not affect anything anymore: Brake Pressure, Camber, Caster, Start/End Boost, Tire Pressure, Handbrake Pressure, Toe, Cam Timing
- FOR DEVELOPERS: Almost all VLT values have been replaced! For editing car handling, edit the files in `CarDataDump` instead, except for these values: `ASPECT_RATIO`, `FRONT_AXLE`, `RIM_SIZE`, `SECTION_WIDTH`, `TRACK_WIDTH`, `WHEEL_BASE`
- Manual transmission no longer gives you an advantage, and the clutch button has been entirely removed
- Nitrous no longer fires in bursts, you need to hold the NOS button down to use it, and it regenerates just like MW
- Speedbreaker has been re-added, bound to the X key on the keyboard and the X button on an Xbox controller

## Known issues

- Drift and drag events revert to the vanilla game's handling, as burnouts, wheelies and drift scoring currently don't work with MW physics
- Skidmarks and tire smoke aren't 100% accurate

## Building

Building is done on an Arch Linux system with CLion and vcpkg being used for the build process. 

Before you begin, clone [nya-common](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common), [nya-common-nfsps](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common-nfsps) and [CwoeeMenuLib](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/CwoeeMenuLib) to folders next to this one, so they can be found.

Required packages: `mingw-w64-gcc`

You should be able to build the project now in CLion.
